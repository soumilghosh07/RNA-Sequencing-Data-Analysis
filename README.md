## **Dataset Description**

The dataset used in this study is sourced from the OmixAtlas repository and comprises single-cell RNA sequencing data from various stages of human embryogenesis, focusing on regions relevant to HSC development. Details about the dataset and its acquisition are provided in the repository's documentation.

## **Experiment Design**

The experiment design involves the following steps:

1. **Downloading the dataset from the OmixAtlas repository.**
2. **Reading and exploring the dataset to understand cell type annotations and sample characteristics.**
3. **Processing the datasets, including quality control, normalization, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction.**
4. **Performing clustering and cell type annotation based on marker gene expression.**
5. **Analyzing the results and visualizing cell populations and marker gene expression patterns.**

## **Data Processing**

The data processing pipeline consists of several steps:

1. **Quality control: Filtering out low-quality cells and genes based on various metrics.**
2. **Normalization: Adjusting the count data to account for differences in sequencing depth.**
3. **Feature selection: Identifying highly variable genes for downstream analysis.**
4. **Dimensionality reduction: Reducing the dimensionality of the dataset using techniques like PCA and UMAP.**
5. **Clustering: Grouping cells into clusters based on their gene expression profiles.**
6. **Cell type annotation: Assigning cell types to clusters using known marker genes.**

## **Results**

The results include:

1. **Visualization of cell populations and clusters.**
2. **Identification of marker genes associated with specific cell types.**
3. **Annotation of cell types based on marker gene expression.**
4. **Analysis of gene expression patterns and biological processes associated with HSC development.**

## **How to Use**

To replicate the analysis or explore the dataset further, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine.**
2.. **Run the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to execute the analysis pipeline.**
3.. **Refer to the documentation and comments within the code for detailed explanations of each step.**
